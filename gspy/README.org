** Important notes

To get some speedups when running this code, make sure the cython extensions
are built. Assuming you have a working C compier on your PATH, this is very
easy. A single command will compile the cython extensions for your system

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   python setup.py build_ext --inplace
#+END_SRC
